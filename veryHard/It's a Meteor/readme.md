    In a video game, a meteor will fall toward the main character's home planet. Given the meteor's trajectory as a string in the form y = mx + b and the character's position as a tuple of (x, y), return True if the meteor will hit the character and False if it will not.
    Examples

    will_hit("y = 2x - 5", (0, 0)) ➞ False

    will_hit("y = -4x + 6", (1, 2)) ➞ True

    will_hit("y = 2x + 6", (3, 2)) ➞ False

    Notes

    The b value will never be zero or blank.
    The m value will always be an integer.
    If the m value is 1, the "1" will be shown.
    For example, "y = x + 5" will be shown as "y = 1x + 5".
    If the m value is -1, the "-1" will be shown.
    For example, "y = -x + 2" will be shown as "y = -1x + 2".
